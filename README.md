# Predicting-heart-disease-with-Neural-Networks
Developed a neural network model to predict heart disease using a dataset containing clinical features and patient information. Analyzed the dataset, built and trained a neural network model, and evaluated its performance on predicting heart disease. Conducted statistical analysis, split data into training and testing sets, built and trained a neural network model and optimized its performance. Successfully developed a neural network model that predicted heart disease which had an accuracy of 84%, providing valuable insights into model performance and metrics.
