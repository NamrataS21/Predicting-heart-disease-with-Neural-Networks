# Predicting-heart-disease-with-Neural-Networks

* Situation: Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. A healthcare organization wants to develop a predictive model that can identify patients at high risk of heart disease based on various factors such as age, sex, chest pain type, and other medical indicators.

* Task: The task is to develop a neural network model that can predict heart disease using a dataset containing various features related to heart health. The specific objectives are:
    1. Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify any patterns or correlations.
    2. Model Development: Develop a neural network model that can classify patients as either having heart disease (1) or not (0).
    3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.


* Action: To accomplish the task, the following actions were taken:

    1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was loaded and preprocessed by splitting it into features (X) and target (y).
    2. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed on the data to understand the distribution of features.
    3. Data Split: The data was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
    4. Scaling: The data was scaled using StandardScaler to have zero mean and unit variance.
    5. Neural Network: A neural network model was built and trained on the scaled training data using a binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer.
    6. Model Evaluation: The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

* Result: The result of the analysis is a neural network model that can accurately predict heart disease. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. Successfully developed a neural network model that predicted heart disease which had an accuracy of 84%, providing valuable insights into model performance and metrics.
